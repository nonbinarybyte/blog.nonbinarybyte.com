## S.E.O.

Before I start, What is "S.E.O"? Well, SEO is "Search Engine Optimization", meaning that key phrases, words, and terms can make or break you. Let's look at some examples!

Let's take 2 terms: "crochet for beginners" (term 1) & "crochet patterns" (term 2)

### crochet for beginners

On the low end you can expect to spend UP TO $0.18 USD, whilst on the high end you can expect to spend up to $2.34 USD, and the competition is high!

### crochet patterns

On the low end you can expect to spend UP TO $0.07 USD, whilst on the high end you can expect to spend up to $1.70 USD, and the competition is high!

### What do these 2 terms share?

well, they rank high in search results, and the more you pay your money the higher they rank.
