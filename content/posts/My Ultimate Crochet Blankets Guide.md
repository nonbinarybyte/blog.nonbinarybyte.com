Also, the receiving blanket will be excluded cause I've honestly got no idea what that is, sorry.

The lovey blanket guide. **This is the smallest blanket**, For optional pazazz you can make & sew a stuffed animal on the Lovey like [this](https://blog.bellacococrochet.com/sleepy-baby-bear-and-bunny-lovey-by-alanna-odea/)

**Measurements**: 12in X 12in (30.5cm X 30.5cm). To get this measurement you may need to loosen or tighten your tension.

You will want to do HDC stitches. If it is going to be a solid Granny square you will want to do DC as that is recommended for *most to all* granny squares.

**Measurements**: 35in X 30in (89cm X 76cm). To get this measurement you may need to loosen or tighten your tension.
